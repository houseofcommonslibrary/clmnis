the from_date.}

\item{to_date}{A string or Date representing a date. If a string is used
it should specify the date in ISO 8601 date format e.g. '2000-12-31'. The

the to_date.}

\item{on_date}{A string or Date representing a date. If a string is used
it should specify the date in ISO 8601 date format e.g. '2000-12-31'. The

}
\description{
\code{fetch_mps_blogs} fetches data from the Members Names platform on blogs
for each MP, with one row per combination of MP and blog.
}
\details{
The from_date and to_date arguments can be used to filter the MPs based
on the dates of their Commons memberships. The on_date argument is a
convenience that sets the from_date and to_date to the same given date. The
on_date has priority: if the on_date is set, the from_date and to_date are
ignored.

The filtering is inclusive: an MP is returned if any part of one of their
Commons memberships falls within the period specified with the from and to
dates.
